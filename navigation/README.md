brushfire.py
- Numbers signify the distance from a point and the obstacle from which the point is.
- Numbers increase from the obstacles including the boundaries of the environment like brushfire until they meet numbers from the other obstacles. 
- Illustrated below

- Essential plot functions were written by [Professor Tony Dear](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/tony-dear)
- Creates GVD like the second image above. The results always vary by environment.
- Illustrated results below are environments with different configurations.
